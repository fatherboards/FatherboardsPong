# FatherboardsPong
"If you want a good team in FTC, you have to make a memetastic game using pictures of your team members." ~Jacob Allen Zipper

This game is a replica of old fashioned pong made by the Fatherboards, FTC team 10087.
We added some of our favorite sounds from our soundboard and made the game sprites meaningful for our team.
We hope that other teams can take our example and make memetastic games of their own.

----KNOWN BUGS----

When you lose, clicking the logo does not always restart the game. Click a couple more times if this error persists.

Ball sprite glitches after hitting the paddle at times.
